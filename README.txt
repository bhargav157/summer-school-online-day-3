# Sticky Blog Layout with CSS Grid

## Objective
This project demonstrates how to create a responsive blog layout using **CSS Grid** for the overall structure, and **position: sticky** for a sidebar that stays fixed as the user scrolls through the main content.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the page, including a header, sidebar, main content, and footer.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles that define the layout using CSS Grid, sticky positioning for the sidebar, and styling for the header, sidebar, main content, and footer.

## Features
1. **Responsive Layout**: The layout adapts to smaller screen sizes using media queries.
2. **Sticky Sidebar**: The sidebar remains fixed at the top while the user scrolls through the main content.
3. **Grid Layout**: The page is divided into a grid with a header, sidebar, main content, and footer.
4. **Dummy Content**: Multiple sections with dummy blog content are added to allow scrolling.
